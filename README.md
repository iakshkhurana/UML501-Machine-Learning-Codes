## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and enter the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd "Machine Learning"
   ```

2. Open the desired notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run the cells:
   - Example: `Assignment-1/sol.ipynb` or `Assignment-2/Assignment-2.ipynb`

## 📚 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Common Python ML/DS libraries (e.g., NumPy, pandas)

## 📝 Notes

- Each assignment folder contains the instructions and corresponding notebooks where applicable.
- Datasets (`imdb_top250.csv`, `weather.csv`, and files in `Assignment-2/`) are included for experimentation and analysis.
- Ensure required dependencies are installed before executing the notebooks.
